# ADR 001: Create Project in Golang

## Context

The author of this project wishes to learn Golang and intends to use this project as a learning opportunity. Outside of personal preference, Golang is a good fit for a command line focused application. It has a large standard library, it is very popular with a large amount of learning material available and it allows for the simple distribution of the application via compiled binaries with no additional dependencies required.

## Decision

- We will use Golang to create the project

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Consequences

- All TypeScript references will need to be stripped out of the project
- A Go project will need to be initialised in the repository (generating a `go.mod` file)
- As the current maintainer is still learning Golang, there may be frequent rewrites of code
