# ADR 000: Adopt Architecture Decision Records

## Context

Keeping a record of decisions made in the project will allow future maintainers to trace back the reason for technical decisions that have been made.

There is an established convention for ADRs that can be followed.

## Decision

- We will keep a record of design decisions alongside the code
- We will follow the format proposed by [Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
- Each design decision will be captured in `/docs/arch/adr-xxx.md`
- Design decisions that are no longer relevant will be renamed to `/docs/arch/adr-xxx-superceded.md` and updated to reflect why they are no longer applicable

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Consequences

- Folder structure to be created for ADRs in `/docs/arch`
- `README.md` created to explain system and provide template
